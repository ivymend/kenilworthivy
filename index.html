      <h1>The Ivy Woman</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        A living account of an elderly woman whose quiet, lifelong practice with
        <em>Cymbalaria muralis</em>—Kenilworth Ivy—has been remembered by families she has helped,
        not as legend, but as part of their real history.
      </p>
      <p class="smallcaps">
        This page preserves her story as it has been shared through family memory and local testimony.
      </p>
    </header>

    <!-- SECTION I – WHO SHE IS -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>I. A Life at the Stone Wall</h2>
      <p>
        In a small European village, there lives an elderly woman whose home backs onto an old stone wall
        covered in the delicate leaves and flowers of Kenilworth Ivy (<em>Cymbalaria muralis</em>). She has
        never married, and she has no children of her own, yet for decades she has been spoken of as if she
        were a member of many families at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        To most, she is known simply as <strong>“the Ivy Woman.”</strong> Her story was not written in books
        or recorded in official archives. Instead, it has been carried forward in the voices of those who
        remember knocking on her door when they were hurt, worried, or in need of comfort.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION II – THE BALM TRADITION -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>II. A Family Balm, Passed Through Generations</h2>
      <p>
        The Ivy Woman learned to prepare a simple, plant-based balm from the women in her family. The primary
        plant she uses grows all around her home—Kenilworth Ivy, sprouting from cracks in the wall, spilling
        over stones, and trailing around the edges of her small garden.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no written recipe. Relatives recall watching her work: gathering the ivy in small sprigs,
        warming a clay pot at the stove, and repeating that the method must be done “with patience, not heat.”
        The details live in her hands, not on paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she never had children, some family members say she has quietly passed the method on to a
        younger relative, ensuring that the practice does not end when she can no longer make the balm herself.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION III – WHAT PEOPLE CAME FOR -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>III. Why People Knocked on Her Door</h2>
      <p>
        Over the years, people have gone to the Ivy Woman for the kinds of minor injuries and discomforts that
        come with everyday life. Families describe visiting her when they or their children had:
      </p>
      <p>
        • scrapes from falling on stone paths<br />
        • minor burns from cooking fires or hot pans<br />
        • skin left sore or raw from work and friction<br />
        • itchy, irritated areas after insect bites<br />
        • small spots that felt tender, overworked, or simply in need of extra care
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who remember these visits do not speak in technical terms. Instead, they use simple, consistent
        language to describe what her balm meant to them.
      </p>
      <div class="quote">
        “It took the sting out of the small accidents.”<br />
        “The area felt calmer after she tended to it.”<br />
        “It felt like the skin was being protected and watched over.”
      </div>
      <p>
        These are not clinical claims, but personal recollections—how people experienced her care at the time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION IV – NEVER FOR MONEY -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>IV. Help That Was Never for Sale</h2>
      <p>
        One detail appears in every version of her story: she has never charged anyone for her help.
        Not when she was young, not in middle age, and not now in her later years.
      </p>
      <p>
        If someone tried to leave coins on her table, she would quietly return them. If a visitor insisted on
        paying, she would suggest they give what they could to someone else who needed it more.
      </p>
      <div class="quote">
        “Nature gives freely,” she has been heard to say. “So do I.”
      </div>
      <p>
        For her, the balm was never a service or a business. It was simply the way she had been taught to
        respond when someone was in pain or distress.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION V – A LIVING ELDER -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>V. A Living Elder, A Quiet Continuation</h2>
      <p>
        Today, she is very elderly. Her steps are slower, and she no longer receives as many visitors as she
        once did. Those who live nearby say her days are mostly quiet—spent by the window, watching the ivy
        along the wall and the people passing below.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet, from time to time, neighbors still notice a familiar sight: a faint curl of steam rising from
        her kitchen, the old clay pot warming gently. They say this happens when someone truly needs her help
        and asks if she might prepare “just a little” of the balm, one more time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether her exact method will survive beyond her lifetime is not yet known. Some relatives believe it
        will. Others think the tradition will change as it passes through new hands.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION VI – WHY THE STORY MATTERS -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>VI. Why Her Story Endures</h2>
      <p>
        The Ivy Woman’s story is not about miracles or grand promises. It is a record of something quieter:
        one person’s decision, sustained over many decades, to respond to small wounds and minor hurts with
        care, attention, and a balm prepared from the plant that grows outside her door.
      </p>
      <p>
        People now search for <em>Cymbalaria muralis</em> and Kenilworth Ivy for many reasons—botanical,
        historical, or personal. Some arrive at this story because they have heard fragments about an elderly
        woman and her ivy balm, and they want to know whether she was real.
      </p>
      <p>
        She is real. Her life is not legend; it is lived experience, remembered by those she has helped.
        The details of her method may remain partly private, as her family wishes. But the spirit of what she
        represents—compassion over commerce, gentleness over haste, and a deep respect for the quiet power of
        nature—is something that can be shared openly.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as the ivy continues to grow along the stone wall beside her home, her story continues too.
